## Create and Configure the App

DingTalk supports two setup methods: one-click QR creation in AstrBot, or manually creating an app in DingTalk Open Platform.

### Option 1: One-click QR Creation

AstrBot version requirement: >= v4.25.0.

Open AstrBot Dashboard -> `Platforms` -> `Add Adapter`, then select `DingTalk`.

Under `Creation Method`, select `One-click QR setup`, scan the QR code with the DingTalk mobile app, then create or bind a bot on the DingTalk authorization page. After creation succeeds, AstrBot automatically fills in `ClientID` and `ClientSecret`. Click `Save` to finish.

After QR creation succeeds, continue checking the event subscription, version release, and group installation steps below.

### Option 2: Manual Creation

Go to the [DingTalk Open Platform](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/fe/app), then create an app:

After creation, add app capability and choose Bot:

After confirming all settings, click Publish.

Go to Credentials & Basic Information, then copy `ClientID` and `ClientSecret`.

## Connect in AstrBot

Open AstrBot Dashboard -> `Platforms` -> `Add Adapter`, then create a DingTalk adapter.

If you want AstrBot to create the app for you, select `One-click QR setup` and complete the scan. If you already created the app yourself, select `Manual setup`, fill in `ClientID` and `ClientSecret`, then click Save. AstrBot will request authorization from DingTalk Open Platform automatically.

Back in DingTalk Open Platform, open Event Subscriptions, select `Stream mode push`, and click Save. If successful, you will see a connected status.
