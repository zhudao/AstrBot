## Installing the astrbot_plugin_matrix_adapter Plugin

Go to `Extensions → Plugins → AstrBot Plugin Market` in the AstrBot WebUI, search for `astrbot_plugin_matrix_adapter`, and click Install.

After installation, navigate to `Platforms` → `Add Adapter` → select Matrix (if the option is missing, try restarting AstrBot or check the plugin installation status).

Click `Enable` in the configuration dialog that appears.

## Configuration

- **`matrix_homeserver` (required)**: The full URL of your Matrix server instance, supports delegation-based auto-discovery. For example, the official instance: `https://matrix.org`
- **`matrix_user_id`**: Your full Matrix username, e.g. `@username:homeserver.com`
- **`matrix_auth_method` (required)**: Your login method. Options: `password`, `token`, `oauth2`, `qr`. It is recommended to use `password` or `oauth2/qr` mode (in oauth2/qr mode, please ensure the device used for authentication/scanning can reach the public address configured in AstrBot)
