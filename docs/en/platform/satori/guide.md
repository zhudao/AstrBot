# Connect to Satori Protocol

## Satori protocol overview

> Excerpt from: https://satori.chat/introduction.html

Satori is a unified chat protocol. It aims to reduce differences between chat platforms and let developers build cross-platform, extensible, high-performance chat applications with lower cost.

The protocol is named after [Komeiji Satori](https://satori.js.org) in Touhou Project. The idea is that Satori can serve as a bridge between chat platforms, as Komeiji Satori communicates telepathically.

The development team behind Satori has long worked on bot development and is familiar with the communication patterns of many platforms. After about 4 years, Satori now has a mature design and implementation. The official project currently provides adapters for more than 15 platforms, covering major messaging services worldwide such as QQ, Discord, WeCom, KOOK, and others.
