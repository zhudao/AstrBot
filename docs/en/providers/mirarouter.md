# Connect MiraRouter

[MiraRouter](https://mirarouter.com/) provides stable and secure OpenAI-compatible APIs for accessing popular AI models with one API key, while centralizing key, usage, and cost management.

## Get an API Key

1. Sign up and log in at [MiraRouter](https://mirarouter.com/).
2. Open the console, create an API key, and copy it. The full key is shown only once, so store it securely.

## Configure AstrBot

Open the AstrBot dashboard and go to **Providers → Add Provider → MiraRouter**. Enter the following values:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Provider Name | `MiraRouter` |
| API Base URL | `https://api.mirarouter.com/v1` |
| API Key | The API key created in the MiraRouter console |

AstrBot automatically adds the `X-APP-CODE: astrbot` identifier to MiraRouter requests.

Save the provider, then open its card and add the models you want to use from the [MiraRouter models and pricing](https://mirarouter.com/models) page.

## Set as Default

Go to **Settings → Provider Settings**, select the MiraRouter model you just added as the default chat model, and save the configuration.

For more details, see the [MiraRouter documentation](https://docs.mirarouter.com/).
